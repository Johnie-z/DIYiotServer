# Swagger UI


Swagger UI is part of Swagger project.  The Swagger project allows you to produce, visualize and consume your OWN RESTful services.  No proxy or 3rd party services required.  Do it your own way.

Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically
generate beautiful documentation and sandbox from a Swagger-compliant API. Because Swagger UI has no dependencies, you can host it in any server environment, or on your local machine.

## What's Swagger?

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swager removes the guesswork in calling the service.

## How to Use It

You can use the swagger-ui code AS-IS!  No need to build or recompile--just use the pre-built files in the `dist` folder.
